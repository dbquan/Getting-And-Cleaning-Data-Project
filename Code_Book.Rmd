Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

Subject: the integer subject ID.
Activity: the string activity name:
Walking
Walking Upstairs
Walking Downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying
Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
